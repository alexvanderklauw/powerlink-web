### ✅ Playwright Installation Complete
- Installed in `automation/playwright/`

- Fase 5: Optimization & growth

### ✅ AI Testing Protocol Added
- Multi-AI review system (Kimi, GPT, Claude)
- 4 test categories: Concept, UX, Copy, Technical
- Structured feedback collection process

## Current Status

**Fase 1: Website Completion** 🔄
- Logo: ✅ Updated
- AI Testing: ⏳ Pending (waiting for user to run)
- Content: ⏳ About, FAQ, testimonials needed
- Technical: ⏳ SEO, mobile, speed optimization
- Legal: ⏳ Privacy policy & terms

## Key Decisions

1. **Phase-based workflow** instead of day-based for better flexibility
2. **AI testing protocol** before finalizing website
3. **Playwright for automation** replacing unstable CDP approach
4. **Focus on website completion first** before outreach

## Technical Notes

- Playwright location: `C:\Users\power\clawd\automation\playwright`
- Test scripts: `test-basic.js` (works), `vimexx-check.js` (debugging), `dns-add-test.js` (development)
- Website location: `powerlink/index.html` (needs rename to floatweb eventually)
- Gameplan: `GAMEPLAN.md` (living document, updated real-time)

## Next Actions (Pending User)

1. Run AI testing on floatweb.nl using multiple AI's
2. Collect feedback on concept, UX, copy, technical
3. Report findings for website improvements
4. Then proceed with content finalization

## Blockers

None currently - waiting for user to complete AI testing phase.
