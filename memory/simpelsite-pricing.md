# SimpelSite Pricing Strategy

## Model: Low Setup + Monthly Subscription

**Why this works psychologically:**

1. **Lower barrier to entry** - €149 feels less scary than €500 upfront
2. **Predictable cash flow** - €19/month feels like "just a coffee per week"
3. **Ongoing relationship** - justifies ongoing support/maintenance
4. **Direct debit (incasso)** - frictionless, "set it and forget it"

**The Anchoring Play:**
- Show "Total Value" (setup + 12 months) to justify the deal
- But emphasize the LOW monthly number in headlines

## Psychology Breakdown

### The Decoy Effect
Growth is positioned as "Most Popular" to guide people there. Starter exists to make Growth look like a deal. Premium exists for those who want "the best."

### The Pain of Paying
- **One-time €500** = painful (wallet feels it)
- **€25/month** = painless (subscription fatigue already exists)
- Direct debit = they don't even see the money leave

### Loss Aversion
- "Cancel anytime" reduces commitment fear
- But ongoing value (updates, hosting) makes them stay
- "Your website goes offline if you cancel" = implied, not stated

### The Rule of 3
- Starter: "I might need more"
- Growth: "This feels right"
- Premium: "Maybe if I grow"
